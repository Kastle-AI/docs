## Integration Notes

1. **Real-time Processing**: Entity creation and updates trigger immediate processing in the campaign workflow.

2. **Batch Operations**: Use the create-multiple endpoint for bulk entity imports to improve performance.

3. **Pagination**: The list endpoint supports pagination through the `next_token` parameter.

4. **Authorization**: All endpoints validate that the JWT user owns both the organization and campaign.

5. **Data Validation**: Entity data is validated according to campaign-specific rules before processing.

6. **Workflow Impact**: Creating, updating, or deleting entities may affect active campaign workflows and automations.
