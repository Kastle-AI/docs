## Overview

The Kastle Microsoft Bookings integration enables seamless appointment scheduling through voice interactions. Here's how the data flows:

```
Borrower ‚Üí Kastle Voice Agent ‚Üí Kastle Booking Service ‚Üí Microsoft Graph ‚Üí Microsoft Bookings ‚Üî Staff Outlook Calendars
```

### Integration Components

1. A **shared Microsoft Bookings page** aggregates the calendars of all participating staff (e.g., loan officers)
2. A confidential‚Äëclient **Azure AD application** grants Kastle application‚Äëlevel access to Microsoft Graph
3. Kastle's **Bookings connector** reads free/busy information and writes new appointments, ensuring one source of truth

## Prerequisites

| **Admin rights** | Global or Bookings admin to create pages; Entra ID admin to register apps & grant consent |
| **Kastle account** | Bookings connector enabled (contact support if not visible) |
| **Internet access** | Outbound HTTPS (443) to `graph.microsoft.com` |
| **Time‚Äëzone alignment** | Ensure tenant time‚Äëzone matches business hours to avoid slot drift |

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Create a Shared Bookings Page

Follow these steps to set up your Microsoft Bookings page:

| 5 | Configure **Booking page settings** ‚Üí service hours, buffer time, lead time, and Teams/Zoom toggle (if virtual meetings) |
| 6 | Click **Publish booking page** to generate the internal link (keep for future reference) |

<Note>
üí° **Tip:** If the **Bookings** option is missing in the M365 admin center, enable it under **Settings ‚ñ∏ Org settings ‚ñ∏ Bookings**.
</Note>

## Step 2 ‚Äì Register an Azure AD (Entra ID) App

### Create the Application

1. Sign in to the **Azure portal** (`https://portal.azure.com`) 
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** ‚Üí **App registrations** ‚Üí **+ New registration**
3. Name the app **`Kastle-Bookings-Connector`** and choose **Accounts in this organizational directory only**

### Collect Application Information

After creation, note the following values from the *Overview* blade:

| Field | Copy From |
|-------|-----------|
| **Client ID** | *Overview* blade |
| **Tenant ID** | *Overview* blade |

### Create Client Secret

1. Navigate to **Certificates & secrets ‚ñ∏ Client secrets ‚ñ∏ + New client secret**
2. Enter a description and expiry (12 months recommended)
3. Click **Add**, then copy the **Secret Value** immediately (it is hidden once you leave the blade)

<Warning>
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Copy the secret value immediately as it cannot be retrieved later.
</Warning>

### Configure API Permissions

## Step 3 ‚Äì Provide Credentials to Kastle

Send the following credentials **securely** to your Kastle administrator:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MSBOOKINGS_CLIENT_ID` | Application (client) ID |
| `MSBOOKINGS_TENANT_ID` | Directory (tenant) ID |
| `MSBOOKINGS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret **value** |

<Warning>
üîí **Security Note:** These credentials provide access to your booking data. Use secure channels (encrypted email, secure file sharing) to transmit them.
</Warning>

---

## Step 4 ‚Äì Connect Kastle to Microsoft Bookings

Once you've provided the credentials to Kastle:

1. Your Kastle administrator will configure the integration in the Kastle platform
2. Test the connection by having a Kastle agent attempt to schedule a test appointment
3. Verify that the appointment appears in your Microsoft Bookings calendar
4. Confirm that staff members receive appropriate notifications

## Security Best Practices

### Application Security
- **Rotate secrets regularly** (every 12 months minimum)
- **Use least-privilege permissions** (only grant necessary Graph API permissions)
- **Monitor application usage** through Azure AD audit logs

### Bookings Security
- **Limit staff access** to only authorized personnel
- **Review booking permissions** regularly
- **Enable notification settings** for appointment changes

### Network Security
- **Whitelist outbound traffic** to `graph.microsoft.com` (port 443)
- **Monitor API calls** for unusual activity patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Authentication failures** | "Invalid client credentials" errors | Verify Client ID, Tenant ID, and Secret are correct |
| **Permission denied** | "Insufficient privileges" errors | Ensure admin consent was granted for API permissions |
| **Time zone mismatches** | Appointments appear at wrong times | Verify Bookings page time zone matches business location |
| **Staff not appearing** | Available slots don't reflect staff calendars | Check that staff members are properly added to the Bookings page |

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify credentials** in Azure portal
2. **Check API permissions** and admin consent status
3. **Test Graph API access** using Microsoft Graph Explorer
4. **Review Kastle integration logs** with your administrator

## FAQ
